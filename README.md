# Recollection

A short 2D, top-down, RPG-style game built in the Unity environment using C#. 

The player must defeat a certain amount of enemies to win the game. There are two "caves/dungeons" to be found and the player may also upgrade their sword using silver found along the way. Enemies will run at the player and attack the player within a certain distance.

The ideas for this game extended way beyond what was actually implemented. Learning C# scripting and the Unity environment took most of the time spent working on this project.
