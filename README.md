# Recollection

A short 2D, top-down, RPG-style game built in the Unity environment using C#. 

The player must defeat a certain amount of enemies to win the game. There are two "caves/dungeons" to be found and the player may also upgrade their sword using silver found along the way.

The ideas for this game extended way beyond what was actually implemented. These included being able to dash/roll over fallen tree logs. Learning took most of the time spent working on this project.
